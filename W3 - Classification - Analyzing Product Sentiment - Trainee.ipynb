I also ordered someImse Vimse Cloth Wipes-Ocean Blue-12 countwhich are larger, had a nicer, softer texture and just seemed higher quality.  I use cloth wipes for hands and faces and have been usingThirsties 6 Pack Fab Wipes, Boyfor about 8 months now and need to replace them because they are starting to get rough and have had stink issues for a while that stripping no longer handles.', 'it came early and was not disappointed. i love planet wise bags and now my wipe holder. it keps my osocozy wipes moist and does not leak. highly recommend it.', 'Very soft and comfortable and warmer than it looks...fit the full size bed perfectly...would recommend to anyone looking for this type of quilt', 'This is a product well worth the purchase.  I have not found anything else like this, and it is a positive, ingenious approach to losing the binky.  What I love most about this product is how much ownership my daughter has in getting rid of the binky.  She is so proud of herself, and loves her little fairy.  I love the artwork, the chart in the back, and the clever approach of this tool.', \"All of my kids have cried non-stop when I tried to ween them off their pacifier, until I found Thumbuddy To Love's Binky Fairy Puppet.  It is an easy way to work with your kids to allow them to understand where their pacifier is going and help them part from it.This is a must buy book, and a great gift for expecting parents!!  You will save them soo many headaches.Thanks for this book!  You all rock!!\", \"When the Binky Fairy came to our house, we didn't have any special gift and book to help explain to her about how important it is to stop using a pacifier. This book does a great job to help prepare your child for the loss of their favorite item. The doll is adorable and we made lots of cute movies with the Binky Fairy telling our daughter about what happens when the Binky Fairy comes. I would highly recommend this product for any parent trying to break the pacifier or thumb sucking habit.\", \"Lovely book, it's bound tightly so you may not be able to add alot of photos/cards aside from the designated spaces in the book. Shop around before you purchase, as it is currently listed at Barnes & Noble for 29.95!\", \"Perfect for new parents. We were able to keep track of baby's feeding, sleep and diaper change schedule for the first two and a half months of her life. Made life easier when the doctor would ask questions about habits because we had it all right there!\", 'A friend of mine pinned this product on Pinterest so I decided to give it a whirl! It is fantastic! If you are a new parent, this will help you keep track of feedings, diaper changes and the like!', \"This has been an easy way for my nanny to record all the key events that happen with my baby when I'm not at home.  Would highly recommend it to someone who wants to stay informed of what your baby is up to while you're not home.The only reason this isn't a 5 is because I think there could have been some more standarad pre-printed options.I plan on ordering another one when we run out of pages in this journal.\", \"I love this journal and our nanny uses it everyday to track on our daughter's sleep, eating and other activities. The layout and design make it very easy to fill in quickly with a comments column to add in details (i.e. we ask the nanny to specify what food she had for lunch, amount of milk she took, specifics of play time--tummy time, walk to park, etc.) I love knowing the details of my baby's day, and I also use it to track weekly on overall schedule patterns and changes (i.e. baby's nap time has moved naturally as she gets older).My only complaint is that there is no real space to communicate back to the nanny, as I sometimes want to reply to the nanny's comments and/or leave her notes about the previous night (i.e. Baby didn't sleep well or baby has rash, etc) or other instructions (Please use sun screen on the baby - it's hot out today) that I often forget to tell her in the rush of the morning. I just stick in post-its now for my notes. All in all, I highly recommend this baby tracker.\", \"This book is perfect!  I'm a first time new mom, and this book made it so easy to keep track of feedings, diaper changes, sleep.  Definitely would recommend this for new moms.  Plus it's small enough that I throw in the diaper back for doctor visits.\", \"I originally just gave the nanny a pad of paper to write down this information for my little one. She would take him to the park and leave the pad behind - I was getting incomplete/inaccurate information when she wohld get home at the end of the day and try to remember naps/feedings/diaper changes. I wanted something she could take with her and also a way to better control how she reported information. This was the perfect solution! Now I'm getting all the information I wanted. There is a very helpful example of how to fill it out. It also has a pouch for additional documents and a section up front for emergency contact info. Each page goes from 7 - 6. This works for me because the nanny starts at 7am and ends before 6pm. I use an app on my phone for tracking when I'm with the baby. I transfer the info from this notebook to my phone. My only complaint: the space is pretty small - they provide useful shorthand, but it's a little difficult to fit some of the info in the space provided. Also, some of the other reviews complain about the 7 - 6 time format. This isn't a real problem for me, but I suppose if you wanted to track an entire day, you would have to use two pages - not too big of a deal. 7am - 6pm is pretty much perfect for daycare/nanny/caregiver situation.\", \"I thought keeping a simple handwritten journal would be nice.  But I haven't used this thing at all, and here's why:1.) When you're breastfeeding, it's often nice to have your phone close by so that you can keep yourself entertained.  If you are able to grab *both* your phone and this notebook - and a pen - consistently - and at 3 in the morning - you are more skilled than me.  (I don't nurse in the same place every time.)2.) You're also often so sleep deprived that - at least for me - I'd forget to look at what time we started on a side, or what side we started on.  I'm not perfect with the app I have either, but at least I just have to mindlessly hit a button.3.) I really like the app I have (Baby Connect).  It gives me better data.  For example, it can tell me how long on average feedings have been taking (helpful as we start to think about sleep training).  It can tell me that I nursed him 177 times last month (granted that serves no useful purpose other than a feeling of perverse satisfaction).\", 'Space for monthly photos, info and a lot of useful stickers come with it. It is exactly what I wanted!!', 'I bought this calender for myself for my second son. It is very colorful and has room on each page to write height, weight, and what baby likes to do. There is also room on each page for a photo to be placed. The calender date boxes have room for a sticker and some fine writing. My only complaint is that it does not have as many stickers as I would like, but I just put asterisks before whatever special event happened that day. I bought one for a friend as she found it very useful as well.', \"I love this little calender, you can keep track of all of baby's firsts. I like the illustrations, and the stickers too.\", 'This was the only calender I could find for the second year. I did one for the first and wanted to continue cause there are so many things to note still after they turn 1. This one was better than the first year one I got him.', \"I completed a calendar for my son's first year and really enjoyed tracking all of his milestones and special moments - so much so that I wanted to continue in the second year since he's still doing amazing and fun things every day.  I really like the simple layout of the calendar and while it might not have all the questions and milestone stickers you want - at least it's something to keep recording all those special moments!\", \"We wanted to get something to keep track of our child's milestones and this is a cute option. There aren't many other choices out there and this does exactly what we wanted.\", \"I had a hard time finding a second year calendar, this is the only one I came across and it is great!  Large enough to write in the squares and has a spot to put that month's picture in as well as some memories. The first two years they change so much I like to jot everything down so I can keep track of all the big milestones...and little ones!  I find it is easier to do this on a calendar vs a baby book.  This way you can fill out the baby book later and have a great reference to do so!\", \"I only purchased a second-year calendar for my son because I had one for my daughter. I was really disappointed with the lack of selection available for second-year calendars in general, so I just got this one because it was one of the only ones. It's an okay calendar. The finish on the pages is glossy which makes it hard to write on with certain pens. The stickers aren't very cute and the pages are pretty old-fashioned looking. Hopefully they will come out with some other calendars for future purchasers.\", \"I LOVE this calendar for recording events of my son's second year of life.  There are plenty of 1st year baby calendars out there and I loved reocording events of his first year and didn't want to just stop now that he is one.  Nature's lullabies second year calendar is perfect for continuing on with daily record keeping.  The stickers are wonderful and helped me think of milestones to record that I might not have thought of on my own.  I highly recommend this calendar!  Plus it's super cute and brat for either gender.\", 'Calendar is exactly as described, but I find the look of it to be very cheap.  There are lots of nice stickers to use.  I was just disappointed it looks so cheap.', 'Wife loves this calender. Comes with a lot of stickers and options to mark the firsts. Includes spaces for milestone photos as well. Sticker borders for photos, etc, it is just a very easy to use scrap booking option. Especially for new moms who dont have enough time to actually sit down, and haul out a ton of scrapbook supplies', 'My daughter had her 1st baby over a year ago. She did receive and fill up a First Year Calendar. When her son was nearing his first birthday she was looking for a Second Year Calendar to record his milestones. Thanks to Amazon I was able to get this for her and she LOVES it. Tender sweet art work - helpful stickers - unique pages to fill. A nice keepsake. A wonderful gift for a one-year old!', 'Extremely useful! As a new mom, tired and inexpedient, not remembering how long ago baby ate, this definitely helped me through the first two months.', \"My son loves peek a boo at this age of 9 months so I thought this book would be perfect! This book doesn't engage him enough though it seems.  He does however like the cover the most if I make pretend blow-kisses and peekaboo gestures with the hands and show him. He also likes when I fan the hair towards his face.Maybe when he's older he will flip the flaps but right now he just likes the mirror at the end and the front cover. If I flip the book through he just takes the book and shakes it around.\", \"One of baby's first and favorite books, and it is washable! I gave 1 less star than perfect because I'd like to see some diversity in the people - not just your typical white family ;)\", 'I like how the book has a hook to attach it to your stroller or car seat - it wont get lost.  Great way to go over family members.', 'Beautiful little book.  A great little short story saying I Love You....Keeps the attention of the baby and then the baby can actually turn the pages and hold on to it when you are finished interacting with it.', \"This book is so worth the money. It says 9+ months on the box but I can't wait for my baby to be born to try to use it before. It's so cute and very interactive! There are flaps to open on every page.\", 'we just got this book for our one-year-old and she loves it.  It's so nice that she can't bite chunks out of it like she can a board book or rip it like a paper one.  She can chew on it, pull on it, and carry it all over the house!  She loves the little flaps that open and is learning simple words like \"daddy,\" \"mommy,\" \"puppy,\" etc.  We love it.', \"The book is colorful and is perfect for 6months and older. The only thing I didn't like was the strong smell of the dyes and/or material. I dunked the pages in detergent. Then let the book dry overnight.\", 'The book is cute, and we are huge fans of Lamaze products, however, this one leaves out some family members (no little brother) and can possibly cause hurt feelings. That said, our baby loves to play with the hands, hair and flaps!', \"What a great book for babies!  I'd been looking for books which couldn't be damaged by my 10-month old's drool...so cloth or plastic books were my options.  This book adds another level to your usual cloth book--a fun flap or moving part on every page.  This interactive book is perfect for my baby!\", \"My son loved this book as an infant.  It was perfect because he would chew on his board books and destroy them, but this one we didn't have that issue.  I love the Lamaze series, they are a lot of fun not only for the child but for the parent.I liked that this book was not only teaching my son about Peek a Boo, but we used it to learn names for family members like grandparents, sister, cat, dog etc.  And of course with it being a lift the flap book, that was additional fun for my son as well.  He's nearly two now and he doesn't look at it as much, but he still does enjoy reading it and playing with it now and again.  I'd say out of all the Lamaze books, this one and Discovery Farm are his favorites.\", 'Our baby loves this book & has loved it for a while now ... He enjoys when I read it to him, and enjoys playing with it on his own.', '', \"My son likes brushing elmo's teeth. Almost too nice of a book to let the kids play with haha :)\", 'This was a birthday present for my 2 year old grandchildren.  They love this book and will sit and go through it page by page themselves .  The pictures are imaginative and appeal to young children.  Would buy it again!', \"This bear is absolutely adorable and I would give it a 5 star rating if it actually giggled or growled like it was suppose to!  I just got it in the mail the other day and was super excited when I saw how cute it was!  If it's something as simple as a dead battery I could handle it BUT I can't even find a place where the batteries would to!  Such a disappointment....it's going back and I have no gift to take down to my new Granddaughter, Kenzie, now!\", 'My baby absolutely loves Elmo and so this book seemed perfect for her.  I'm happy to say I was right:  this book is nice and soft and beautifully illustrated so my little one takes it everywhere and \"reads\" it all of the time. While Elmo is the main character of because he hides on each page, other Sesame Street characters are also featured which is fun, too. Another great, interactive, Elmo centric book that I would recommend for the Sesame Street/Elmo lovers is \"Twinkle, Twinkle Elmo\" (which is also available on Amazon for a great price).', \"I bought two for recent baby showers!  The book is soft and interactive, great for any baby, and the bright colors are beautiful.  Lastly, who doesn't love Elmo!\", 'We wanted to get another book like the Big Birds Friends softplay book, and we only found the two Elmo books. This one is fun, but the Big Bird book has more variety and is more creative.', \"This is a cute little peek-a-boo story book.  It's soft.  It's safe.  And it is easy for baby to handle.\", 'My 3 month old son loves this book. We read it over and over and he smiles and laughs every time we find Elmo and say &#34;peekaboo Elmo!&#34;  We have a few different soft books and this is the most colorful and fun to read. And baby adores it, so 5 stars for sure.', 'Very cute interactive book! My son loves this book! The bright colorful illustrations make this great for babies & toddlers.', 'Bought for granddauchildren and they play with them all the time.  Love reading to them.  Soft, so if they fall on them, they are safe. When they use the Elmo book, the kiss Elmo.  Got when they were 9 mos, now they are two and we are still having fun with them.  They love to see how high they can stack the blocks before it falls over.  I buy as a baby present.', \"I have teething babies and these were great for entertaining the, and letting them chew and droll all over the, without worrying about ruining them. They were great for setting them off to their side to encourage rolling over and crawling. Great Christmas gift for the younger baby and didn't break the bank.\", 'This book is boring. Nothing to stimulate my granddaughter. It is a waste of money. I would not recommend it', 'It is so hard to find cloth books with ACTUAL images on them! So many have unrealistic portrayals of what animals/objects look like, but this one is fantastic. EXACTLY what we were looking for!!When we teach our 1 year old what a \"lion\" is, we want to show him a REAL lion... not a drawing that looks nothing like a real lion.', 'for the young child, very cute...so happy they can &#34; read&#34; something there is little or no chance of them destroying..many happy reading memories', 'not bad but not as interesting to my 1-year old as I thought. Mot interactive [texture, etc] but cute anyway', \"A friend bought me this calendar when our daughter was born.  Love it!  It's so fun and will be a great momento.\", 'Quick and Easy to keep up with all the first milestones of a little one, especially for a busy, first-time Mom.', \"I searched high and low for a first year calendar and settled on this one based on the reviews.  I am so happy that I did.  Perfect for jotting down quick memories throughout the month and remembering dates of baby's &#34;firsts&#34;.  Will be fun to look back on.  Also has spots for personalization and pictures.\", 'This is a very good gift for a new mother.  You would want to give it to the parents as soon as baby is born so that they can start from the very beginning to chart the &#34;firsts&#34;.  I had one of these calendars for each of my five children.  They enjoy looking up their &#34;firsts&#34; especially as they are now parents themselves.', '', 'Absolutely love it and all of the Scripture in it.  I purchased the Baby Boy version for my grandson when he was born and my daughter-in-law was thrilled to receive the same book again.', 'Bought as a gift for my daughter in law. She loved it. Simple but a place to put important memories down. I loved the verses at bottom of pages.', \"I didn't realize this was a religious product, so I almost returned it.  (Not that I have anything against that, but some of the pages ask for favorite scripture, prayers for the baby, etc.). Wasn't sure that fir with out lifestyle, but the book has all the right ages for memories, so we are keeping it.\", 'OMG.....we loved this baby book! Perfect for the memories you want to remember when your little one gets bigger and starts asking questions. It even had a place for foot and hand prints for when your baby is born which is the main reason why we liked this one. Also it has pockets for keepsakes and little places to put first locks of hair....etc! So cute and is a great baby shower gift!', 'Beautiful book, I love it to record cherished times in my great granddaughters life with the beautiful pastel pink color.', \"Really happy with this purchase. I was looking for an english baby book (I'm French and the daddy is Flammish) and this is the perfect one. Lot of info to fill in : family, firsts...and mini pockets to preserve hair, maternity bracelet...Really happy!\", 'I was pleasantly surprised upon receiving the memory book entitled,  \"My Kindergarten Year\". It is the perfect way to record one's Kindergarten experience through photographs and detailed descriptions of this very important time in your child's life. The questions are fun for your child to answer and record while serving its purpose for the parent.I'd recommend this book to everyone with a Kindergartener.', \"I'm so glad I stumbled upon these gem. My son has already started answering questions and I think it will be a great memory to look back years later to see how he answered the questions.\", \"The book is just a few pages long with a few words to each page.  Just short enough to keep the attention of my 6 month old son.  We have the Elephant as well so when he's older it will be neat to see the realization of the association between the stuffed toy and the book character\", 'This is well made a very pretty,.  It gives a nice light and will be used for years...I recommend it highly.  It also makes a great gift.', 'Try this out for a spring project !Easy ,fun and affordable wall decals ...Fine quality and brightens up any room.. 5+ **********', 'The reason:Small sizeHard to apply on the wall because most part of flower only in one pieceYou will know how waste money it is when second day morning you see all the flowers fell on the floor in a roll.', 'Would not purchase again or recommend. The decals were thick almost plastic like and were coming off the wall as I was applying them! The would NOT stick! Literally stayed stuck for about 5 minutes then started peeling off.', \"I could not get these Winnie the Pooh themed wall decor stickers in New Zealand and these were a very cost effective option that I was very impressed with.  They were easy to stick on and look fantastic on the wall - they don't &#34;look&#34; like stickers at all.  Very professional and very seamless on the paintwork.\", 'Very satisfied about the product, grat design, it came as ir said on page.  I highly reccomend the product, and I follow buying more.', 'very nice Divine Mercy Pendant of Jesus now on chain around my neck.  Love It!  Divine Mercy represents Jesuswho offers us an ocean of divine mercy.  Pray to God for our country. You need HIM in your lives!', \"I love these wipes.  They are so simple and soft and they are a great price for reusable wipes.  They actually get my baby clean and dry during diaper changes.  And I know that I'll find a million other uses for them after our diaper days are done.  I'm ordering more of them right now!\", 'It is nice and looks great on my wall. It was just a bit smaller than what I thought, but that was my fault and not taking the measurements.', \"We bought the pins as my 6 year old Autistic son was able to open or break open normal safety pins we needed to use for his night time clothes.  These new pins are significantly more sturdy and he hasn't learned how to open them and only once has he broken one open.  I seem to recall that their shipping price was more than a bit on the high side of reasonable though given the size of the package...\", 'These were  good quality--worked fine--heavy duty--able to be used in any way needed and filled my need as no others', 'A great safety pin that has lots of uses.  Easy to find with bright colors and a great bargain for a dozen.', 'While the diaper pins are attractive, the metal in the pins I received are flimsy and did not hold up to the thick fabric I used them on. Fortunately there was no baby involved, so no little on was stuck.', 'These diaper pins went to Honduras to hold the cloth diapers we also sent with the missionaries. It is difficult to find diaper pins in our &#34;disposable&#34; age. In Honduras, they do not have &#34;Pampers&#34;. They appreciated the kits we sent.', \"It has been many years since we needed diaper pins, but I do like to pin my socks together through the wash and have never lost one yet. I was using brass dressmaker pins but they tended to open up during the wash cycle. My wife suggested diaper pins and we tried them. Thery're working perfectly and staying together through the washing. Matter of fact they can get a little tricky to open, but of course that was the idea. Recommended to keep your socks &#34;friended up&#34;.\", \"As another reviewer noted, these are great for matching socks before washing.  Now once the socks come out of the washer, I hang them to dry with the pins still on.  The socks stay on the line to dry without clothespins, they just hang with one sock on each side of the line.  After they are dried, I just open the pin and leave it by the hamper on a shelf.  As I put dirty socks into the hamper, I grab a pin and use it.  Has saved a lot of time and I don't have the problem of lost socks or mismatched socks on my feet.  Great idea and am glad I read about this here on the reviews.  Wish I had done this my whole life.\", 'The steel part is not strong at all, unlike the old diaper pins, which I still have.  Very hard to work it through a thicker fabric.  Would not recommend.', 'I really thought I was getting a dozen pins..turns out I should have counted the pins in the picture..as there are only 10. I am sad..and I think that they are overpriced. I only use them to mark yarn when I crochet so I will be going back to regular safety pins.', \"Like = sharp ends that pierce through my diapers easier.  Dislike = the sides bend which is a pain.  That said, I am pushing them through older velcro tabs because the velcro on my diapers doesn't work anymore.\", 'These are the right color, so I am happy, but the steel on the needle bends easily, and is not as strong as I expected. I am pinning material for a dog bed with these, not diapers.', 'Diaper pins are hard to find locally!  This is a useful item to have - no matter the purpose...', \"I am pleased with the design I just wish the actual picture was bigger an putting it together doesn't make sense the numbers aligned with the branches don't make any sense compared to the picture they give you as an instruction -- you have to sort of free hand. I had to start it half way up my wall so it made a difference an could actually be seen -- as far as it hold up I put it up about 2 weeks ago an it had not peeled off at all.\", 'These do not stick to the wall. They start to peel as soon as you stick them to the wall.', \"Was so excited to get this product for my baby girls bedroom!  When I got it the back is NOT STICKY at all!  Every time I walked into the bedroom I was picking up pieces off of the floor!  Very very frustrating!  Ended up having to super glue it to the wall...very disappointing.  I wouldn't waste the time or money on it.\", 'I ordered this Rosary for a friend because it looked lovely in the photo and it is blessed by Pope Francis.  I was not disappointed as it is just beautiful, made with crystal, and knotted in between the Our Fathers.  I am giving this to my friend along with a copy of the novena of Our Lady Untier (or Undoer) of Knots, for whom Pope Francis has a strong devotion.  I definitely recommend this Rosary and would buy it again in a heart beat.', 'An excellent value and quality for the price.  Just right for wearing around the neck orattaching to a Brown Scapular or some such. And the Blessing makes the Item all the more Precious.', \"I was so excited to get this nativity.  I have been watching it for months and I finally had an excuse to spend $25.00.  It is beautiful and I am very happy with the look of the item.  I am not so happy about the music box.  The song is WAY too fast and it had to play it through once to even recognize the song.  I don't know if there is a way to slow down a music box; if there is I wish someone would tell me.  I still love the nativity but I am not as excited as I would be if the music had been right.Buyer beware... beautiful nativity; not so great music\", \". I am pleased with product. I love the bangles however they are a bit small. Had to slid them on with lotion. I like a snug fitting bangle but whew these were tough to get on!! If my hand was a hair bigger they wouldn't have fit. They are on to stay. I have small hands also. I got the size for large kid small adult and they fit wrist but tough over the hand. Overall satisfied with product and fast shipping!\", 'This was for my 2 yr. old great granddaughter and she has a lot of fun playing with the set and pretend cooking.', 'I like those bibs. they are very useful. easy to wash and dry. the price is awesome. My friends also like them very much.', 'This bibs provided very good protections for messy eaters, my grandson is a 20 months old beautiful boy who loves to eat his marinara pasta with his fingers. My daughter loved this bibs, pasta elbows or curls fall in the front pocket when missing the mouth. Easy to wash too.', \"This is such a cute ornament, I collect nativity ornaments and this is perfect for my collection! Can't wait to add it to my nativity tree!\", ... ]"

She carries this giraffe with here everywhere.  I really score big points buying this for her.\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"I bought Vulli ...\"}, \"Is it worth it?  With so many inexpensive teethers on the market in all shapes and sizes, why is this one so popular?  Yes, it's trendy.  Yes, the celebrities all have these for their babies.  Yes, it's European.  But is it really worth the price for your baby?That's the question I've been asking myself ever since receiving Vulli Sophie the Giraffe as a gift from a well-meaning (and much-hipper-than-I-am) friend.  My answer is a qualified \\\"yes.\\\"  Here are the benefits.  This teether is several inches tall, making it larger than many other teethers.  Also, it has a lot of appendages (four legs and a long neck).  These features make it easy for my uncoordinated baby to hold on to this teether.  That's a big benefit.  Also, the shape of the legs and head result in a variety of teething choices.  My baby prefers to grip the teether by the legs and to chew on the giraffe's ears or nose.  I've seen other babies who prefer to chew on the front or back legs.  One baby I know even prefers to chew on the giraffe's rump.  With so many choices, your baby is bound to discover one that she/he likes.  Additionally, the teether makes a squeaky sound when squeezed (think about a traditional dog squeaky toy).  My baby likes this sound (as do my dogs).  Finally, the all-rubber surface of this teether makes it easy to clean.  These are the benefits.Here are the downsides.  The rubber on this teether is a bit stinky and definitely has a taste that my baby isn't thrilled about.  She's willing to put up with it, but I can tell that the taste isn't as pleasant to her as that of some of her other teethers.  Also, this teether doesn't have any rough patches or bumps, and those bumps are soothing to babies with serious teething going on.  Finally, this teether costs double or triple what other teethers cost, and that's a big downside if you're buying this for your own baby.  So, weigh the pros against the cons and make a decision if this teether is right for you.\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"Is it worth it? ...\"}, \"I ordered the two pack for two different grandbabies who will be born soon.

Right now, it's on sale on Amazon and so not that bad but it's a simple squeaking tether. Agreed it may be safe due to food grade paints and such but for $25, you can buy much better toys.

Now that the research is out on phthalates and other toxic substances in baby toys, I think it's more important than ever to find good quality toys that are also safe for our babies to handle and put in their mouths.

Sophie's long skinny neck and legs are easy for my daughter's small hands to hold.  My little girl loves to nibble on Sophie's ears, horns, and feet.  Plus, I think this little giraffe is just so cute.  Also, just as an anecdote: When I first offered Sophie to my daughter, she was NOT interested.  The squeak was a bit loud for her, and the natural rubber taste was different for her.  I thought I may have wasted $18.  However, over time, my daughter has really come to like Sophie.

Lily really enjoys hearing Sophie squeak and will smile whenever Sophie makes a noise or pops her head up from Mommy's lap to say hello.People have stopped and commented on Sophie and to them I have stated, \\\"It's worth every penny.\\\" I can't imagine not having this toy, it has become part and parcel with Lily's daily existence. She is soothed by it, loves to chew on it and seems endlessly entertained by it.Someday, Sophie will have earned her retirement. She will relocate to Lily's keepsake box.

Every other toy is an eyesore.- The squeak is slightly annoying (like any squeak toy) but it really does make my baby smile when we are out and he gets fussy- The rubber is soft enough that my baby can chew on it without injuring himself and not too soft to puncture (the chewing sound does make a rubbing rubber sound that makes me cringe, but baby loves it).- The &#34;small&#34; parts, I like that the legs, neck and head are small enough for my baby to grab and chew on without being too small.CONS:- Slightly expensive, but worth it in my opinion.- Another mom friend said that the squeak sounds similar to that of her dog's toys so the dog likes to play with this too.  Having two (2) dogs that love squeak toys I am amazed that my dogs have not touched this toy.- I wish there were real instructions (not just vague information on the box) concerning cleaning.  If the squeaker gets wet it sounds like Sophie has a serious cold for a few days until it dries.  Along with this I am also potentially concerned about mold or anything growing inside - no worries yet but I can see how this may occur.It may sound strange that all of my PROS seemed to have CONS attached, but I would like to be clear - I would buy this product again and I would highly recommend this product to anyone with an infant.\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"My husband gave me ...\"}, \"I bought this for my granddaughter whose name happens to be Sophie.

The paint seemed to be on the plastic and did not seem to rub off; the plastic seems to be good quality in that it is very thick and durable for hard chewers.  We unfortunately had a hard time keeping it away from our small dogs because of the squeaky component because our daughter loved playing with it as much as chewing on it!Cons: the squeaky part of ours broke after a month.  It seemed to get dislodged because we could feel it inside and it felt like it came out of place but we couldn't fix it.  It also is hard to clean so that you don't get water inside it and compromise the squeaky part of it and/or simply trap water inside.Had ours not broken, we would have said it's maybe worth the money because it certainly kept our daughters attention more than other teethers she had, but we were quite disappointed that ours broke as we haven't used ours since.\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"We read and heard ...\"}, \"My daughter began teething at 3 months and did not have her first tooth pop until 7 months.

So, when I read the reviews for Sophie, I figured all these people couldn't be wrong. When I first got her, I was glad that Sophie is not hard, inflexible rubber, which she looks like from the picture. She is much softer, like the rubbery consistency of a dog toy, which some people have already commented on. My thoughts regarding Sophie's likeness to a dog toy is not a far-fetched comparison; this is especially so with the way the squeaker sounds. Our dog LOVES this thing! I have to hide it, but he goes sniffing for it. Anyway, when our son first got his hands on this thing, it went straight into his mouth. And he smiles every time Sophie squeaks, which is so cute to see. He also smiles when he \\\"gums\\\" Sophie's body, especially her legs (hooves, actually). So, judging from the way my son puts it in his mouth, and smiles when he does so, I'd say she was a worthwhile purchase, but it is very pricey, nonetheless, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It's handmade, made of natural rubber (from the sap of the Havea tree), hand-painted with food grade colors, and the finished product takes 14 steps to complete. It's been around since 1961 (or 65, I can't remember)and hasn't changed since. But even though she'll be a keepsake, the price is exaggerated.

My granddaughter, Violet is 5 months old and starting to teeth. What joy little Sophie brings to Violet. Sophie is made of a very pliable rubber that is sturdy but not tough. It is quite easy for Violet to twist Sophie into unheard of positions to get Sophie into her mouth. The little nose and hooves fit perfectly into small mouths, and the drooling has purpose. The paint on Sophie is food quality.Sophie was born in 1961 in France. The maker had wondered why there was nothing available for babies and made Sophie from the finest rubber, phthalate-free on St Sophie's Day, thus the name was born. Since that time millions of Sophie's populate the world. She is soft and for babies little hands easy to grasp. Violet especially loves the bumpy head and horns of Sophie. Sophie has a long neck that easy to grasp and twist. She has lovely, sizable spots that attract Violet's attention. Sophie has happy little squeaks that bring squeals of delight from Violet. She is able to make Sophie squeak and that brings much joy. Sophie's smooth skin is soothing to Violet's little gums. Sophie is 7 inches tall and is the exact correct size for babies to hold and love.As you well know the first thing babies grasp, goes into their mouths- how wonderful to have a toy that stimulates all of the senses and helps with the issue of teething. Sophie is small enough to fit into any size pocket or bag. Sophie is the perfect find for babies from a few months to a year old. How wonderful to hear the giggles and laughs that emanate from babies who find Sophie irresistible.

       "\"Sophie, oh Sophie, your time has come. My granddaughter, Violet is 5 months old and starting to teeth. What joy little Sophie brings to Violet. Sophie is made of a very pliable rubber that is sturdy but not tough. It is quite easy for Violet to twist Sophie into unheard of positions to get Sophie into her mouth. The little nose and hooves fit perfectly into small mouths, and the drooling has purpose. The paint on Sophie is food quality.Sophie was born in 1961 in France. The maker had wondered why there was nothing available for babies and made Sophie from the finest rubber, phthalate-free on St Sophie's Day, thus the name was born. Since that time millions of Sophie's populate the world. She is soft and for babies little hands easy to grasp. Violet especially loves the bumpy head and horns of Sophie. Sophie has a long neck that easy to grasp and twist. She has lovely, sizable spots that attract Violet's attention. Sophie has happy little squeaks that bring squeals of delight from Violet. She is able to make Sophie squeak and that brings much joy. Sophie's smooth skin is soothing to Violet's little gums. Sophie is 7 inches tall and is the exact correct size for babies to hold and love.As you well know the first thing babies grasp, goes into their mouths- how wonderful to have a toy that stimulates all of the senses and helps with the issue of teething. Sophie is small enough to fit into any size pocket or bag. Sophie is the perfect find for babies from a few months to a year old. How wonderful to hear the giggles and laughs that emanate from babies who find Sophie irresistible. Viva La Sophie!Highly Recommended.  prisrob 12-11-09\""

       "\"I'm not sure why Sophie is such a hit with the little ones, but my 7 month old baby girl is one of her adoring fans.  The rubber is softer and more pleasant to handle, and my daughter has enjoyed chewing on her legs and the nubs on her head even before she started teething.  She also loves the squeak that Sophie makes when you squeeze her.  Not sure what it is but if Sophie is amongst a pile of her other toys, my daughter will more often than not reach for Sophie.  And I have the peace of mind of knowing that only edible and safe paints and materials have been used to make Sophie, as opposed to Bright Starts and other baby toys made in China.  Now that the research is out on phthalates and other toxic substances in baby toys, I think it's more important than ever to find good quality toys that are also safe for our babies to handle and put in their mouths.  Sophie is a must-have for every new mom in my opinion.  Even if your kid is one of the few that can take or leave her, it's worth a try.  Vulli, the makers of Sophie, also make natural rubber teething rings that my daughter loves as well.\""

Had I not been within hearing range it could have been fatal. The strange sound she was making caught my attention and when I went to her and found the front curved leg shoved well down her throat and her face a purply/blue I panicked. I pulled it out and she vomited all over the carpet before screaming her head off. I can't believe how my opinion of this toy has changed from a must-have to a must-not-use.

There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genieplus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.']"

       "'Baby Luke can turn a clean diaper to a dirty diaper in 3 seconds flat. The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into \"what diaper smell\" in less time than that. I hesitated and wondered what I REALLY needed for the nursery. This is one of the best purchases we made. The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend\\'s house REALLY reinforced that!! There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genieplus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn\\'t any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.'"
